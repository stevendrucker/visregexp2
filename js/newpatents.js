        "Executive Summary (when available)": "\"     Designing, creating, programming, and importing digitally represented virtual objects to provide a real life simulated world can be extremely tedious and time consuming.  The invention extrapolates a true 3-dimensional (3D) geometric model from a 3D object in which such model can be utilized to create virtual representations of real objects.  For example, a 3D object can be constructed from two or more 2D images and the 3D object can be analyzed with dimensional analysis to create such model.  The true 3D geometric model can be generated with accurate real world attributes such as proportion, scale, dimensions, length, size, weight, physical properties, chemical properties, chemical composition, etc.  The claims are directed to a content aggregator that can construct a 3D object from a collection of 2D content and a model component that can create a true 3D geometric model that includes scaling in proportion to size within the real world.\"",

        "Executive Summary (when available)": "\"Users and software developers can typically query a relational database and receive results back instantaneously.  However, when querying large data sets users must wait longer amounts of time for the query to process.  This results in a perception of poor performance and stalls the query debugging process.   The invention is a method for processing a relational query with a stream engine by creating streaming data events corresponding to relational data items, assigning progress intervals to the streaming data events, and providing incremental results of the relational query as the events are processed by the stream engine.  This allows the stream engine to process a relational table and relational query without modifying the stream engine.  The claims are directed to converting a relational query into a streaming query and providing incremental results to a user without forcing the user to wait for the query to complete.\"",

However, maintaining the original while saving a number of derivative versions presents a strain on storage resources and may introduces copyright issues. The invention is an architecture that can create an extensible synch file that stores a set of commands representative of various media transformation actions, each of which is synchronized with a presentation of the original media.  Accordingly, when presenting the original media in conjunction with the synch file, the commands can be applied to the output of the original media to produce a derivative media presentation or experience.  The claims are directed to system to provide a derivative media experience by having a user interface to receive transformation of the metadata based original media asset and generating of synch file.\"",

This invention is a set of methods for analyzing how users search and then configuring the search interface to best suit a given user.  As a user searches the web, data is collected that can be classified into patterns of search types.  Characteristics of the search may include things like number of queries, amount of time spent, number of forward and back navigations, etc.  Then the search UI can be customized to best match the type of searching for a specific user.\"",

This invention displays images based on computed similarity confidence data between images.   Based on the computed similarity confidence data, a visual distribution can be displayed to the user.  The visual distribution can be a two-dimensional layout of images with images in closer proximity to one another computed to have a greater probability of representing the same object.  The visual distribution can then be utilized by a user to sort, organize and/or tag images.   Claims are directed to extraction, comparison and generation of a visual distribution of images based upon computed similarity confidence data.\"",

The invention is an improved method for browsing and searching a digital media collection that displays representative thumbnails of the media objects wrapped in clusters in vertical columns along a compressed horizontal timeline.  Each cluster of photos is laid out as a grid of thumbnails when zoomed in with an aspect ratio matching that of the screen in order to make maximum use of the screen space in order to avoid unnecessary panning.\"",

Shared displays such as movie theater screens are used to provide information to many viewers at once.  However, most of these systems are not interactive and viewers have no influence over what is displayed.  The invention overcomes the problems of previous work by providing a generalized infrastructure for interactive shared displays in which viewers control the display by sending messages using a number of different devices (e.g., PDA cell phone etc.)  In the invention, the navigational interface of a hypertext browser (such as a Web browser) is modified to enable users to interact with such displays.  The shared display infrastructure imposes a number of constraints - including input latency, paucity of input, one-way communication from the input device to the shared display, etc. on the ways in which the viewer can interact with the system.\"",

For example, a media variations browser shows a single movie in the center of the screen while 4 clusters of movies are shown in the periphery which share a common actor or a common director with the central movie. A user can then select any item in a peripheral cluster and bring that to be the focus for new clusters of movies.  This method of browsing can be generalized to almost any space whose objects have been richly annotated with metadata.\"",

However, the large number of postings, the lengthy text descriptors of each posting, the limited display resolution, and the limited display area combine to limit the amount of information a user can glean from the textually cluttered tree display.  This invention replaces some or all of the text descriptors with thin graphical lines in the threaded message visualization.  Top levels of each thread may include a text descriptor while the rest of the thread is represented by the thin graphical lines.  The thin graphical lines may be colored in accordance with their context or their relationship to other postings, their length may vary according to the length of the posting, or their indentation may vary according to the relative times of the postings.

Disclosure Summary: Virtual reality (VR) user interfaces allow a user to feel immersed in a computer-generated space. Numerous single-user VR systems (e.g., games) have been implemented based upon either text or graphics. Multi-user VR systems have also been implemented. Multi-user games and chat systems (text or graphical) are characterized by static spaces and transient user identities, making these games and chat systems relatively simple to implement over low band-width, open networks like the Internet. Graphics-based military simulation networks (e.g., SIMNET) utilize a dedicated peer-to-peer protocol to deliver graphics information across the network. Text-based multi-user domains (MUDs) provide server-based persistent worlds that are user-definable and accessible by large numbers of users. Conventional graphics-\"",
